# Weather API Homework
## Process
- Created an HTML file and linked Bootstrap, Jquery, CSS and js files

- Created a button click function in the javascript file that would trigger all functions on the page.

- Created a variable for city input that would tap into the Open weather API and call the right forecast for the input city

- Used then function to create variables for temp, humidity and wind speed by going through the "main" arry.
- printed variables on page using ID's in html
- returned values back out to original function
- Created another ajax call for UV index because it is in a different URL
- Created a for loop to loop through the 5 day forecaset

## Wasn't able to-
Get the 5 day forecast on the page
- I created variables but couldn't get them to populate on the page, May have too many variables. Don't think I used the for loop right. Screen shot provided

Get the icons to show up
- I  linked the URL and did an ajax call but wasn't sure how to proceed and ran out of time

Save to local storage
- I don't think I had the code in the right place.
